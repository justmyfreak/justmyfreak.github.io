When designing mobile app, there is one thing that should be decided early whether the app will be a native, a web, or hybrid app. Each type of app uses different technoligies to build, and consideration of each pros and cons is needed. The right choice of technolgy is one of the key to have successful app or product.

We already know that hybrid app try to be the combination of web and native app. Hybrid app combine pros of both web and native app. PhoneGap / Apache Cordova is a widely used framework that allows developer to write hybrid app. 

[PhoneGap 3.x Mobile Application Development HOTSHOT](https://www.packtpub.com/application-development/phonegap-3x-mobile-application-development-hotshot) is a book about hybrid app development using PhoneGap / Cordova. Instead of giving text-only explanation, the book gives explanation through code by giving 12 exciting PhoneGap projects. The book is good for those who like to learn by 'show me the code'. If you are experienced mobile developer and want to learn some part of the book by example, you are good with the book then,

The book starts with configuring SDKs and development environment. Then explain how to create frist PhoneGap project. As the project goes, reader will learn more about PhoneGap capabilies. 

I think the most attracting part of the book is *Project 12 : Building a Backend - Working with Parse*. Backend as a Service (BAAS) such as [Parse](http://parse.com) is quite popular nowadays. BAAS allows developer to not worrying about server setup such as web server, database, etc. Mobile app often uses BAAS as their back end due to simplicity of BAAS. The book do a great job on explaining how does hybrid app interact with backend through CRUD example.
