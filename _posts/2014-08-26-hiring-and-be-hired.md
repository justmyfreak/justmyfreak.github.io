# Hiring new Talent
Hiring new talent seems to be a problem for some company.....

This post was inspired after reading The New King Makers. There are a lot of ways to hire people. From old school way by posting job vacancy on media to newly trending Acqhiring. Media used is growing rapidly from newspaper, job vacancies listing web site to dedicated professional social media. Posting job on those media with some requirements and hoping the best talent to apply for that position is still being a popular way to recruit new talent. There is nothing wrong with that. But, there will be a better way to recruit new talent.

# The art of Acqhiring
Acqhiring (Acquire-hiring) or hiring by acquiring a company is a new trend in hiring new talent. Many of giant company (especially in IT company) are doing this. Facebook’s 2008 acquisition of FriendFeed, for example. They want to get Bret [Taylor] which is now Facebook's CTO. Joe Hewitt who came in the Parakey acquisition, wrote Facebook’s first iPhone application.

By acquiring a company, we will get the whole company (assets, pattents, etc) and its people.
