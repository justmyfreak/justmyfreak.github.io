# Hiring new Talent
Hiring new talent seems to be a problem for some companies, whether for startup or well established company. Getting the right person on the right position is not easy. This post was inspired after reading [The New King Makers](http://thenewkingmakers.com/). There are a lot of ways to hire people. From old school way by posting job vacancy on media to newly trending Acqhiring methos. The Media used for posting job vacancy is growing rapidly from newspaper, job vacancy listing web site to dedicated professional social media like LinkedIn. Posting job on those media with some requirements and hoping the best talent would apply for that position is still being a popular way to recruit new talent. There is nothing wrong with that. But, there will be a better way to recruit new talent.

Some companies provide a unique way to post their job vacancy especially for software developer. Soundcloud and Grooveshark gives information about their job vacancies on their JavaScript console.log. If you are a web developer, head over to their site and open your Chrome Dev tool. You will see their job offers on console tab :)

# The art of Acqhiring
Acqhiring (Acquire-hiring) or hiring by acquiring a company is a new trend in hiring new talent. Many of giant company (especially in IT company) are doing this. Facebook’s 2008 acquisition of FriendFeed, for example. They want to get Bret Taylor which is now ex-Facebook's CTO. Joe Hewitt who came in the Parakey acquisition, wrote Facebook’s first iPhone application.

By acquiring a company, we will get the whole company (assets, pattents, etc) and its people.
