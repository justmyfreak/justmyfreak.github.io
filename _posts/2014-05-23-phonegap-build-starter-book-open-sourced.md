[PhoneGap Build Starter](https://leanpub.com/phonegapbuild) is a starter guide to create mobile application using web technologies using [PhoneGap Build Service](http://build.phonegap.com). The book covers easy step by step guide to build mobile application as well as PhoneGap Build advance features. The price of the book is FREE, but donation will always be appreciated and every donation will be donated to [Watsi](https://watsi.org).

# Why is it FREE?
I decided to make the book available for free since I think it's the time to contribute back to the community. I learned the technology for free, so it will be my contribution. :)

# Why Watsi?
Watsi is a global crowdfunding platform for healthcare that enables anyone to donate as little as $5 to directly fund life-changing medical care for people in need. The suggested price of the book is $4.99 and it's pretty low price. I wont earn much donation from suggested price, so I decided to support Watsi to give life-changing medical care since every single donation can have direct impact to people.

# The Book Manuscript is Open Sourced
I decided to open sourced book's manuscript because I know that my grammar is bad. I couldn't improve the book quality by my self :) Book's manuscript can be found on [GitHub](https://github.com/justmyfreak/phonegap-build-starter-book). Please [star the project](https://github.com/justmyfreak/phonegap-build-starter-book/stargazers) :)
